This section contains metadata to map elements in existing datasets to their RoughWorld counterparts. Academic data will not be stored on this repository but it is intended that it be straightforward to include copies of exising datasets within associated folders and for software to enable the corresponding data to be used by the tools of this repository. For example, Image-net images could be used to visualise objects.
